    "body": "President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday said he was picking Vince Haley, who helped lead the speech-writing department during Trump's first term, to be director of the Domestic Policy Council, which drives implementation of the administration's agenda. \n\n I am proud to announce that Vince Haley, who served as Director of Policy and Speechwriting on my Winning Campaign, will lead my Domestic Policy Agenda as Director of the Domestic Policy Council. Vince is very well-educated, and has a brilliant mind for Policies that work for the American People. He holds a Bachelor's Degree from the College of William & Mary, a Law Degree and a Master's Degree in Foreign Affairs from the University of Virginia, and a Master's in European Law from the College of Europe. Vince helped lead the Speechwriting Department in my First Administration, working to convey our message to the Public. Prior to joining my 2016 Campaign, he worked for twelve years in a variety of roles for Newt Gingrich, a man who I greatly respect.\n\n  The 2024 Presidential Election was won by an unprecedented margin, which many in the Mainstream Media and Washington, D.C. did not expect, because the size and magnitude of our MAGA Movement was greatly underestimated. The American People gave us a Mandate to deliver on our Promises, and put AMERICA FIRST. As Director of the Domestic Policy Council, Vince will help make life better for ALL Americans, and unify our Country through SUCCESS. Together, we will defeat Inflation, rapidly bring down Prices, secure the Southern Border, cut Taxes and Regulations, reignite Growth, build the Greatest Economy in History and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

        "body":"President-elect Trump announced on Tuesday night that Vince Haley, his campaign speechwriter, will be the next chief of the Domestic Policy Council (DPC).  \n\n “As Director of the Domestic Policy Council, Vince will help make life better for ALL Americans, and unify our Country through SUCCESS. Together, we will defeat Inflation, rapidly bring down Prices, secure the Southern Border, cut Taxes and Regulations, reignite Growth, build the Greatest Economy in History and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,” Trump said in an announcement on TruthSocial. \n\n Haley, who worked in the White House during Trump’s first term, will be in an influential post that oversees the development and implementation of the president’s domestic policies across the federal government. \n\n The DPC is part of the Office of Policy Development, and it is made up of various secretaries and White House officials. \n\n Haley is the protégé of Stephen Miller, Trump’s senior advisor, whom the president-elect selected two weeks ago to serve as deputy chief of staff for policy. \n\n Haley also has close ties with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) who he worked for in various roles for over a decade, including serving as Gingrich’s campaign manager during the Georgia Republican’s 2012 presidential run.  \n\nHaley is an attorney by training. In the Tuesday release, Trump praised him as “very well-educated and has a brilliant mind for Policies that work for the American People.” "
